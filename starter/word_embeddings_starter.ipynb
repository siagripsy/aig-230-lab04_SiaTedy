    "## Word Embeddings: Learning Meaning from Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this lab:** learn how *continuous vector representations* (embeddings) are learned from data, and how they are used in practical NLP workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:\n",
    "1. Explain **distributional semantics** (\"meaning from context\").\n",
    "2. Train word embeddings using **Word2Vec** and **FastText** (with Gensim).\n",
    "3. Use embeddings for **similarity search** and **analogy / vector algebra**.\n",
    "4. Visualize a word embedding space and interpret what you see.\n",
    "5. Explain why embeddings help with **sparsity** and **generalization** compared to n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry relevance (why you should care)\n",
    "Even in the era of transformers, embeddings remain widely used for:\n",
    "- **Semantic search** and query expansion  \n",
    "- **Similarity / recommendation** (nearest neighbors in vector space)  \n",
    "- **Clustering** and exploratory analysis  \n",
    "- Lightweight NLP systems where large models are too expensive"

    "1. What is the main limitation of **one-hot vectors**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: One hot vectors are very large and mostly full of zeros, and they do not show any relationship between words. Similar words like “dog” and “cat” look completely different to the model.\n",

    "Vector algebra (analogies) demonstrates one of the most remarkable properties of word embeddings: **semantic relationships are encoded as geometric directions**. This section is included because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validates embedding quality** — If embeddings capture meaningful structure, analogies should work\n",
    "2. **Illustrates the \"linear substructure\" hypothesis** — Relationships like gender, tense, or country-capital are often parallel vectors\n",

    "4. **Foundation for downstream tasks** — Understanding vector arithmetic helps with transfer learning and feature engineering\n",

    "### How vector algebra works\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings often capture relationships as **directions** in vector space. The idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the relationship between **king** and **man** is similar to the relationship between **queen** and **woman**, then their difference vectors should be approximately equal.\n",

    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{king} - \\text{man} + \\text{woman} \\approx \\text{queen} \\]\n",

    "### Important caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analogies are an intrinsic evaluation** — They test the embedding space itself, not real-world task performance\n",
    "- **Results are dataset-dependent** — A model trained on news articles may not capture analogies about cooking or medicine\n",
    "- **Not always reliable** — Even good embeddings can fail on specific analogies due to data biases or polysemy (words with multiple meanings)\n",

Also, meanings can be mixed (for example a word with multiple meanings), so query expansion could pull results from the wrong topic. Finally, if the model was trained on a small dataset, it may not generalize well and could produce unstable results for real users."

    "1. How do embeddings solve the sparsity and \"no similarity\" issues of one-hot vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Embeddings use dense vectors instead of huge sparse ones full of zeros. Similar words end up with similar numbers, so the model can see relationships between them. This lets the system understand that words like “doctor” and “nurse” are related. It also reduces memory use and makes learning more efficient.\n",

They are also used in customer support systems to route tickets to the right category. Another example is clustering news articles by topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When would you choose FastText over Word2Vec?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ I would choose FastText when the data has many rare words, typos, or word variations. FastText uses subword information, so it can handle words it has never seen before. This is useful for social media text or technical documents. It also helps with languages that have many word forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is one risk or limitation of word embeddings that a practitioner should watch for?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ One risk is that embeddings can learn biases from the training data. They can also mix different meanings of the same word, which may hurt downstream tasks. Another issue is that small or unbalanced datasets can lead to poor quality vectors. This means the results might not be reliable in real systems.\n"

Overall, using bigrams makes the embeddings more precise for technical contexts compared to the model trained without bigrams."
